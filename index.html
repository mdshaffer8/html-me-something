                    <p>In the beginning of the year, I took a weekend camping trip with by boyfriend, Sam, to <a href="http://floridahikes.com/hogisland" target="blank">Hog Island</a>. We spent two nights Tent Camping, which is one of our favorite things to do!
                        We canoed down the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withlacoochee_River_(Florida)" target="blank">Withlacoochee River</a> and took a break to eat some smoked mullet that we had bought from a roadside fish stand.</p>

                    <p>For Sam's Birthday we took a trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades_City,_Florida" target="blank">Everglades City</a>. It's the coolest small town I've ever been to. We stayed at the Rod and Gun Club, which is a historic
                    lodge built in the 1890s. My favorite things to do here were visiting the Big Cypress Bend Boardwalk, taking an Airboat Tour through the mangroves, and taking a day road trip
                        through <a href="http://www.floridarambler.com/florida-bike-hike-trails/loop-road-everglades-tamiami-trail/" target="blank"> Old Loop Road.</a></p>

                    <p>Sam and I took a trip to Puerto Rico to celebrate a friend's birthday. Sam lived here before when he was in the Coast Guard, so he knew all the great spots to
                    go to! We arrived early so we stayed the first night in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utuado,_Puerto_Rico" target="blank">Utuado</a>, which is in the mountains. For the rest of the trip, we stayed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabela,_Puerto_Rico">Isabela</a>. We also got a chance to take
                    a day trip to <a href="https://sanjuanpuertorico.com/old-san-juan/" target="blank">Old San Juan</a> since our flight was delayed by several hours.</p>

                    <p>I took a short weekend trip to Orlando with my sister, my niece, and Kai. We stayed at a hotel with a lazy river! The kids got to have their own little room
                    with a bunk bed. It was just a fun, spur of the moment idea and a great way to spend some quality time with the fam.</p>
