                    </header>
                    <p>Took a weekend camping trip with by boyfriend, Sam, to Hog Island. We spent two nights Tent Camping, which is one of our favorite things to do!
                    We canoed down the Withlacoochee River and took a break to eat some smoked mullet that we had bought from a roadside fish stand.</p>

                    <p>For Sam's Birthday we took a trip to Everglades City. It's the coolest small town I've ever been to. We stayed at the Rod and Gun Club, which is a historic
                    lodge built in the 1890s. My favorite things to do here were visiting the Big Cypress Bend Boardwalk, taking an Airboat Tour through the mangroves, and taking a day road trip
                    through Old Loop Road.</p>

                    <p>Sam and I took a trip to Puerto Rico to celebrate a friend's birthday. Sam lived here before when he was in the Coast Guard, so he knew all the great spots to
                    go to! We arrived early so we stayed the first night in Utuado, which is in the mountains. For the rest of the trip, we stayed in Isabela. We also got a chance to take
                    a day trip to Old San Juan since our flight was delayed by several hours.</p>

                    <p>I took a short weekend trip to Orlando with Erica (sister), Dallas (niece), and Kai. It was a quick trip to just relax and get our mind off of things for a moment.
                    These are the times that are most special to me.</p>
